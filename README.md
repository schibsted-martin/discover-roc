### Roc basics  
_Roc_ solves _JS fatigue_ and provides a better developer experionce (DX)
Read more http://www.getroc.org/, https://github.com/rocjs/roc [documentation](https://github.com/rocjs/roc/blob/master/docs/README.md)

### Roc project components (packages, plugins, templates...)
> A little confusing to what is what and how it should be used. A little sparse documentation.

#### Roc extensions (packages & plugins)
Create a project using one or many Roc extension as a starting point. `npm i --save-dev <package>`
Essentially a predefined collection of _npm libraries_ with minimal and working configuration.

> The difference between a package and a plugin is not that big. Plugins are smaller and cannot be used
on its own, it adds capabitilites but has no "base". At least on package always needs to be included.

#### Roc template
Will help you set up a project through interactive _CLI_. `roc init <template>`
Essentially a wrapper to _Roc extensions_ with interaction.

### Artifactory
Not so open source. Needed for most new _Roc_ components.

Setup with variables to be able to use cross projects.

### Storybook
Minimal app to run/test/develop _React_ components.

### Reflections building "Notifications"
> Truly stand-alone requires some thinking. Do we go full retard?
>
> API integrations a bit messy because of cross site scripting. We should either expose everything via a proxy or find a nice "local proxy" solution.
>
> Not having Redux is a context switch.
>
> Passing parameters to API needs maybe a standard (even if it is ours)
>
> Picking up data from cookies - is it really the best practice?
